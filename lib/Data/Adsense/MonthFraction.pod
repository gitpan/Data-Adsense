=head1 NAME

Data::Adsense::MonthFraction - fraction of a month in AdSense time zone

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 month_fraction

    my $fraction = month_fraction ();

This calculates the days of the month divided by how many days have
passed so far, in the Adsense time zone. This is for extrapolating
values for the current month. For example, if you have had 1000 views
this month, to get the extrapolated views until the end of the month,

   my $views_so_far = 1000;
   my $guessed_views = $fraction * $views_so_far;

The value of C<$fraction> includes hours and minutes.
